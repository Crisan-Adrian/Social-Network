# Social-Network
This is a social network-like application I created as an extended project for advanced programming methods. The app features a graphical user interface created with JavaFX that uses custom elements and CSS. The data persistence and access is done using a database. The app features basic user sign-up and login. After logging in a user can send, receive and answer to friendship requests and communicate through 1 on 1 and group messages. The app also facilitates the creation of user events. User can choose to attend and whether they want to receive notifications about upcoming events.
